"""Run untrusted code in a resource-limited, short-lived subprocess.

Three layers of defence, in the order they take effect:

1. **Static analysis** (:mod:`agentdebugger.sandbox.policy`) runs in *this*
   process and rejects the submission before a child is ever spawned.
2. **Kernel limits** (``setrlimit``) are applied in the child before it executes
   anything: address space, CPU time, and a zero file-write budget. These hold
   even if the child ignores signals.
3. **A wall-clock deadline** in the parent, which kills the child's entire
   process group — so a fix that spawns threads or grandchildren still dies.

The child is started with a scratch working directory, a scrubbed environment
and ``-I`` (isolated mode), so it cannot import anything from the caller's tree.
